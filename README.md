# RuSentEval
### Linguistic Source, Encoder Force!

RuSentEval is an evaluation toolkit for sentence embeddings for Russian.

In this repo you can find the data and scripts to run an evaluation of the quality of sentence embeddings. 

RuSentEval, an enhanced set of 14 probing tasks for Russian, including ones that have not been explored yet. We apply a combination of complementary probing methods to explore the distribution of various linguistic properties in five multilingual transformers for two typologically contrasting languages â€“ Russian and English. 

Our results provide intriguing findings that contradict the common understanding of how linguistic knowledge is represented, and demonstrate that some properties are learned in a similar manner despite the language differences.
